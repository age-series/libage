/**
 * A linear series of Resistors.

 * This class is optimized for a common simulation case where, say, a wire is represented by a large number of discrete
 * simulation elements (often Resistors). Matrix size--and thus solve time--goes up \Omega(n^2), O(n^3) with the number
 * of nodes, so these "line graphs" tend to be wasteful of simulation time.
 *
 * Instead, if the line graph property is guaranteed, a much faster KCL/KVL solution exists for a series of resistors,
 * which would be familiar as the typical "voltage divider". The runtime of this algorithm is linear in the number of
 * resistors.
 *
 * The Line is a component, and can be added and [Component.connect]ed as any other. The individual [parts] are _not_
 * [Component]s and, thus, cannot be talked about in [Circuit] terms. They do, however, support many fields of other
 * [Component]s in their own way.
