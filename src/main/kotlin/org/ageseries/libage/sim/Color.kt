 *
 * It should be noted that these are, with exception where noted, _not_ suitable for immediate use in game engines. Most
 * engines will have their own Color abstraction and colorspace (often implicitly sRGB or linear RGB), and these are
 * often designed to be submitted to the graphics hardware or pipeline directly. While conversions in this module can
